Kiarash began his Ph.D. program in economics at SFU in 2020. His work is primarily applied, and his broader research interests include political economy and labour economics. In recent years, Kiarash's work has been focused on questions such as how voters respond to economic sanctions in Iran, how immigration trajectories affect immigrants’ economic success in Canada, and how access to 3G Internet has impacted female labor force participation in Iran. When he’s not conducting research, Kiarash is usually hiking or reading.
