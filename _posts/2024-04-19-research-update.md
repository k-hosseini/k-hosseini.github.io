In my ongoing research on economic sanctions and voter behavior in Iran, I've been analyzing how different types of sanctions affect political preferences and voting patterns. The preliminary results suggest some interesting patterns in how voters respond to economic pressures.

## Key Findings

1. **Timing Matters**: The impact of sanctions appears to be most significant in the immediate aftermath of their implementation, with voter behavior showing notable shifts in the first 6-12 months.

2. **Type of Sanction**: Financial sanctions seem to have a more pronounced effect on voter behavior compared to trade restrictions, possibly due to their more direct impact on daily economic activities.

3. **Regional Variations**: The response to sanctions varies significantly across different regions of Iran, with urban areas showing more pronounced changes in voting patterns.

## Methodology

The study uses a combination of:
- Survey data from multiple waves
- Regional economic indicators
- Voting records from recent elections
- Natural language processing of social media sentiment

## Next Steps

In the coming months, I plan to:
- Expand the dataset to include more recent elections
- Conduct additional robustness checks
- Prepare the paper for submission to academic journals

Stay tuned for more updates as the research progresses. If you're interested in this topic or have suggestions, feel free to [contact me](/about/).
